# Oscillator and Resonant Circuit Calculator

## Overview

This project is a Python script for calculating and selecting standard component values for oscillator and resonant circuits. It performs various calculations related to electronic circuits, including finding the resonant frequency of LC circuits, determining the required inductance and capacitance for specific frequencies, and selecting the closest standard resistor, capacitor, and inductor values.

## Features

- **Resonant Frequency Calculation**: Calculates the resonant frequency of an LC circuit.
- **Component Selection**: Finds the closest standard values for resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
- **Oscillator Frequency Calculation**: Computes the frequency of an RC oscillator.
- **Capacitor and Inductor Standard Values**: Includes a list of standard component values for quick reference.

## Requirements

This script requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting, though not used in the current version)
- `scipy` (for scientific constants and calculations)
